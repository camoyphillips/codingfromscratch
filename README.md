##  Projects Included

### 1.  Google Books API Integration

#### Description
This project uses the Google Books API to search and display book titles based on a keyword (e.g., "JavaScript"). It dynamically creates a list of books, each with a title, thumbnail, and link.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  - HTML/CSS  
  - Vanilla JavaScript  
  - Google Books API  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Parsing deeply nested API responses  
  - Handling missing image links gracefully  

- **Future Features**:  
  - Add search input for custom queries  
  - Implement pagination for large results

### 3.  JavaScript Slideshow

#### Description  
A simple image slideshow that allows users to navigate through a series of images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  - HTML/CSS  
  - JavaScript for image swapping

### 4.  Monty Hall Simulation

#### Description  
A simulation of the classic Monty Hall problem run in the browser. It demonstrates how switching doors affects win probability over 10 trials.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  - HTML/CSS  
  - JavaScript (random logic, counters, DOM updates)  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Implementing game logic  
  - Visualizing results  

- **Future Features**:  
  - User interaction (click to choose a door)  
  - Adjustable number of simulations
